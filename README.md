# Capstone Database Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Capstone Database, leveraging both SQL queries and Python for data insights. The project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be combined to analyze real-world data effectively.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on advanced data analysis using the Capstone Database. The analysis is divided into two main components:
1. **SQL Queries**: Extracting and manipulating data directly from the database.
2. **Python Analysis**: Further processing and visualizing the data extracted using Python.

## Capstone Database Structure

The Capstone Database consists of the following tables:
- **Customers**: Contains customer information.
- **Employees**: Stores employee details, including their territories.
- **Orders**: Records customer orders, including dates and statuses.
- **Products**: Includes product details like categories and suppliers.
- **Order Details**: Provides a breakdown of the items included in each order.

These tables are interconnected through key relationships, allowing for complex queries and multi-dimensional analysis.

## Repository Contents

- **SQL Query File**: Contains the SQL scripts used to extract and analyze data from the Capstone Database.
- **Python Analysis File**: Includes Python code to further analyze the SQL results, perform data visualizations, and generate insights.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a local environment with access to the Capstone Database.
3. Run the provided SQL queries to extract the necessary data.
4. Use the Python script to analyze the extracted data and generate visualizations.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib / seaborn / plotly** (for visualizations)
- **psycopg2** (for PostgreSQL connection)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be combined to perform efficient and insightful data analysis. By leveraging both, deeper understanding and informed decisions can be achieved based on the available data.
